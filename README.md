# Team-4 Nurse Attrition Analysis in American Healthcare
 Team 4's group project GitHub repository for MGT 6203 (Edx) Spring of 2024 semester.

## Description
This project explores the drivers of nurse attrition in American healthcare institutions, aiming to provide actionable insights for reducing turnover rates. We utilize a synthetic dataset reflecting realistic scenarios in the healthcare domain for our analysis.

## Installation
Clone the project repository and install the required dependencies.

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/MGT-6203-Spring-2024-Edx/Team-4
cd Team-4
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

## Usage
To interact with the model training and eda interface, run the Streamlit app:

\```bash
streamlit run app.py
\```

For detailed model training and analysis, refer to the Jupyter notebooks within the `Nbs/` directory.

Execute the pipeline for automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning:

\```bash
python ml_logic/pipelines.py
\```

...Include additional usage instructions as needed...
